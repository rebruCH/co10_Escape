    DESCRIPTION:
    Make bomb from object with timer and cutting wires.

    INSTALATION:
    - copy folder "bomb" into your mission folder
    - include line 
        #include "bomb\cfgFunctions.hpp"
    into your CfgFunctions class in description.ext file

    Example:
    
    class CfgFunctions
    {
        #include "bomb\cfgFunctions.hpp"
    };
    
    USAGE:
    - place unit in editor
    - place object in editor (barrel)
    
    In object init line put
    null = ["object", "time", "kit", "debug"] execVM "bomb\bomb.sqf";
    
    Example:
    null = [this, 10, true, false] execVM "bomb\bomb.sqf";
    
    CONFIG:
    "object" - object to transform to bomb, default: this
    "time" - time in seconds for bomb defuse, default: 10
    "kit" - boolean value if needed tools to defuse bomb, default: true
    "debug" - boolean value if need show right wire to cut, default: false

    SETTINGS:
    
    open file ../bomb/settings.sqf in bomb folder where you can change internal settings of script.
    
    _choices - array of choices to cut wires, more choices will have more colors to cut, default: red, green, blue
    _explosion - change classname of explosion, possible values in comments
    _matrix - show size of maxtrix with colors, default: big
    _expertMultiplier - if expert is defusing bomb, unit will have more time to defuse bomb, default: 2  (time * 2x)
    _disableAce3 - disable/enable ACE3 interaction menu

    FEATURES:
    - friendly hint with instructions
    - hint is showing only to defuser
    - ace3 support
    - multiplayer / dedicated server friendly
    - easy installation
    - plug & play system
    - specialist have more time to defuse bomb

    PLANNED:
    - dialog for cutting wires
    - cutting wires in right order
    - when wrong cut, timer will accelerate
    - "slippery hands" ( this is where I move toolkit from unit inventory and spawn it next to him, as he can't cut wires when he dont have toolkit)
    - probability of second wiring ( first wiring is dummy )
