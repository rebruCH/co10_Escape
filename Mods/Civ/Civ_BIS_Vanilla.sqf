/*
 * Description: This file contains the vehicle types spawned in the mission for the civilian side.
 * "Random array" (used below) means that array will be used to spawn units, and that chance is 1/n that each element will be spawned on each spawn. The array can contain 
 * many elements of the same type, so the example array ["Offroad_DSHKM_INS", "Pickup_PK_INS", "Pickup_PK_INS"] will spawn an Offroad with 1/3 probability, and a 
 * Pickup with 2/3 probability.
